\title{Function to generate a basis function.}
\description{
This function is to construct a data-matrix of basis function using the \code{n} response observations.
The response can be continuous or categorical. The function returns a matrix of \code{n} rows and \code{r} columns.
The number of columns \code{r} depends on the choice of basis function.
Polynomial, piecewise polynomial continuous and discontinuous, and Fourier bases are implemented.
For a polynomial basis, \code{r} is the degree of the polynomial.

bf(y, case = c("poly", "categ", "fourier", "pcont", "pdisc"),

\arguments{
  \item{y}{A response vector of \code{n} observations.}
  \item{case}{Take values \code{"poly"} for polynomial, \code{"categ"} for categorical, \code{"fourier"} for Fourier, \code{"pcont"} for piecewise continuous, and \code{"pdisc"} for piecewise discontinuous bases.}
  \item{degree}{For polynomial and piecewise polynomial bases, \code{degree} is the degree of the polynomial. With \code{"pdisc"}, \code{degree=0} corresponds to piecewise constant.}
  \item{nslices}{The number of slices for piecewise bases only. The range of the response is partitioned into \code{nslices} parts with roughly equal numbers of observations. See details on piecewise bases for more information.}
  \item{scale}{If TRUE, the columns of the basis function are scaled to have unit variance.}

\details{
The basis function \eqn{f_y} is a vector-valued function of the response \eqn{y \in R}. There is an infinite number of basis functions, including the polynomial, piecewise polynomial, and Fourier.
We implemented the following:

1. Polynomial basis: \eqn{f_y=(y, y^2, ..., y^r)^T}. It corresponds to the \code{"poly"} argument of \code{bf}. The argument \code{degree} is \eqn{r} of the polynomial is provided by the user. The subsequent \eqn{n \times r} data-matrix is column-wise centered.

2. Piecewise constant basis: It corresponds to \code{pdisc} with \code{degree=0}. It is obtained by first slicing the range of \eqn{y} into \eqn{h} slices \eqn{H_1,...,H_k}. The \eqn{k^{th}} component of \eqn{f_y \in \mathrm{R}^{h-1}} is \eqn{f_{y_k}=J(y \in H_k)-n_k/n, k=1, ..., h-1}, where \eqn{n_y} is the number of observations in \eqn{H_k}, and \eqn{J} is the indicator function. We suggest using between two and fifteen slices without exceeding \eqn{n/5}.

3. Piecewise discontinuous linear basis: It corresponds to \code{"pdisc"} with \code{degree=1}. It is more elaborate than the piecewise constant basis. A linear function of \eqn{y} is fit within each slice. Let \eqn{\tau_i} be the knots, or endpoints of the slices. The components of \eqn{f_y \in \mathrm{R}^{2h-1}} are obtained with
    \eqn{f_{y_{(2i-1)}} = J(y \in H_i)}; \eqn{f_{y_{2i}} =  J(y \in H_i)(y-\tau_{i-1})} for \eqn{i=1,2,...,h-1} and
    \eqn{f_{y_{(2h-1)}}  =  J(y \in H_{h})(y-\tau_{h-1})}. The subsequent \eqn{n \times (2h-1)} data-matrix is column-wise centered. We suggest using fewer than fifteen slices without exceeding \eqn{n/5}. 
    
4. Piecewise continuous linear basis: The general form of the components \eqn{f_{y_i}} of
\eqn{f_y \in \mathrm{R}^{h+1}} is given by \eqn{f_{y_1}  =  J(y \in H_1)} and
    \eqn{f_{y_{i+1}} =  J(y \in H_{i})(y-\tau_{i-1})} for \eqn{i=1,...,h.}. The subsequent \eqn{n \times (h-1)} data-matrix is column-wise centered.
    This case corresponds to \code{"pcont"} with {degree=1}. The number of slices to use may not exceed \eqn{n/5}.

5. Fourier bases: They consist of a series of pairs of sines and cosines of increasing frequency.
A Fourier basis is given by \eqn{f_y=(\cos(2\pi y), \sin(2\pi y),..., \cos(2\pi ky), \sin(2\pi ky))^T.}
The subsequent \eqn{n \times 2k} data-matrix is column-wise centered.

6. Categorical basis: It is obtained using \code{"categ"} option when \eqn{y} takes \eqn{h} distinct values \eqn{1, 2,..., h}, corresponding to the number of sub-populations or sub-groups. The number of slices is naturally \eqn{h}. The expression for the basis is identical to piecewise constant basis.

In all cases, the basis must be constructed such that \eqn{F^TF} is invertible, where \eqn{F} is the \eqn{n \times r} data-matrix with its \eqn{i}th row being \eqn{f_y}.
